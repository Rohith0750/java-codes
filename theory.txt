Method Overloading in Java

Method Overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists 

Key Rules for Method Overloading
Same Method Name: The overloaded methods must have the same name.
Different Parameter Lists:
Vary the number of parameters.
Change the type of parameters.
Rearrange the order of parameters (if the types are different).
Return Type Does Not Matter: You cannot overload methods based on the return type alone.

Why Use Method Overloading?
To perform similar tasks with different types or numbers of inputs.
To make the code more readable and maintainable.
