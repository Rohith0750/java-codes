 * Polymorphism in Java (OOPs) - Detailed Explanation
Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), along with Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Abstraction.

The term "polymorphism" is derived from Greek words:

"poly" means many,
"morph" means forms.
Thus, Polymorphism means "many forms", which allows a single interface (method or object) to behave differently in different scenarios.

Types of Polymorphism in Java
Java supports two types of polymorphism:

Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
Compile-time polymorphism is also known as Method Overloading. In this type, multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different number of arguments or different types).

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
âœ… Resolved at compile time.
âœ… Methods have the same name but different signatures.
âœ… Achieved by defining multiple methods with the same name in the same class.


2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
Runtime polymorphism is also called Method Overriding. It occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
âœ… Resolved at runtime (dynamic method dispatch).
âœ… Involves inheritance.
âœ… The method in the child class must have the same signature as in the parent class.
âœ… The overridden method is called via reference of the parent class.
